## Viewer for SQL database on Godot, based on network HTTP requests
This is absolutely not a great coding example, but an attempt to complete the learning task to make an editing app for SQL database on a platform of choice, so I did in on a platform that I knew the best.

The working performance of this example is horrible, because I lack the knowlege of making good parallel getter code on GDScript, expecially on 3.5 without JS'ish async/await
This editor also heavily relies on a Nest Js server or any other DB server, that can send literal SQL requests over HTTP's Get and Post.
